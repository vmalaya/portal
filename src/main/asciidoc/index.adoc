[[getting_started_running_the_service]]
== Running the service
The portal backend is written using https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/vmalaya/portal.git
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,cmd]
----
cd portal
mvnw spring-boot:run
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL:

include::{snippets}/api-example/curl-request.adoc[]

This request should yield the following response in the
https://github.com/mikekelly/hal_specification[Hypertext Application Language (HAL)]
format:

include::{snippets}/api-example/http-response.adoc[]

Note the `_links` in the JSON response. They are key to navigating the API.

[[getting_started_creating_a_task]]
== Creating and manipulating task
Now that you've started the service and verified that it works, the next step is to use
it to create a new task. As you saw above, the URI for working with notes is included as
a link when you perform a `GET` request against the root of the service:

include::{snippets}/api-example/http-response.adoc[]

To create a task, you need to execute a `POST` request to this URI including a JSON
payload containing the title and description of the task:

include::{snippets}/task-create-example/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created note:

include::{snippets}/task-create-example/http-response.adoc[]

To update the task please use following request:

include::{snippets}/update-task-example/curl-request.adoc[]

Expected response:

include::{snippets}/update-task-example/http-response.adoc[]

You can assign task to a student with `POST` request:

include::{snippets}/assign-student-to-task-example/curl-request.adoc[]

The response with status code `201` is expected:

include::{snippets}/assign-student-to-task-example/http-response.adoc[]

To delete task, just use "DELETE" request:

include::{snippets}/task-delete-example/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `203 No Content`:

include::{snippets}/task-delete-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[getting_started_creating_a_class]]
== Creating and manipulating a class

To create a class, you need to execute a `POST` request to the following URI including a JSON
payload containing the title and description of the task:

include::{snippets}/class-create-example/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created` and contain a
`Location` header whose value is the URI of the newly created note:

include::{snippets}/class-create-example/http-response.adoc[]

To delete a class, just use "DELETE" request:

include::{snippets}/class-delete-example/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `203 No Content`:

include::{snippets}/class-delete-example/http-response.adoc[]

You can assign task to a class with `POST` request:

include::{snippets}/assign-class-to-task-example/curl-request.adoc[]

The response with status code `201` is expected:

include::{snippets}/assign-class-to-task-example/http-response.adoc[]

To assign a student to a class, you need to execute a `POST` request to the following URI including a JSON
payload containing the student and task resources meant to me mapped:

include::{snippets}/assign-student-to-class-example/curl-request.adoc[]

The response from this request should have a status code of `201 Created`:

include::{snippets}/assign-student-to-class-example/http-response.adoc[]
